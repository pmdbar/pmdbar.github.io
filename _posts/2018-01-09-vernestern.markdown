My first web design project was for a cartoonist operating under the alias "Vern E Stern".  The artist had the following requests for the site:
style matches the art,
simple design,
about section with picture,
mobile browser friendly,
domain specific e-mail.

I started by registering a domain name with Amazon Web Services, then I found a nice template on https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp.  I removed some input boxes and added all the sketches to the site then updated the about and contact section.  Then I set-up hosting with http://www.hostgator.com/ and set up e-mail.  The site is simple, works with the art and allows Vern to have a specific and professional e-mail to correspond with potential patrons.

Here is the final site http://www.vernestern.com/
