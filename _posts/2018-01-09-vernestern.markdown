My first web design project was for a cartoonist operating under the alias "Vern E Stern".  The artist had the following requests for the site:
style matches the art,
simple design,
about section with picture,
mobile browser friendly,
domain specific e-mail.

I started by registering a domain name with [Amazon Web Services][aws], then I found a suitable template from [w3schools][w3schools].  I modified the template by removing the stock user input boxes then added specific content and some other minor changes.  I set-up hosting with [HostGator][hostgator] and used their services to set up e-mail.  The site is simple, works with the art and allows Vern to have a specific and professional e-mail to correspond with potential patrons.

Here is the final site [Vern E. Stern][ves].

[aws]: https://aws.amazon.com/
